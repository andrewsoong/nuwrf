INTRODUCTION

MERRA2WRF 2.0 is a completely rewritten Fortran program used to process
select HDF4 or netCDF files from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for
Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset, and convert into "WPS intermediate
format", a big-endian binary format used by the Weather Research and Forecast
(WRF) Preprocessing System (WPS).  The MERRA dataset are available via
the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC)
web page, at http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/DataHoldings.pl.

The WPS is responsible for collecting basic meteorological fields for use
as initial and lateral boundary conditions in the WRF model.  Basic 
requirements are:  
* pressure
* geopotential heights
* horizontal winds
* temperature, and
* moisture (preferably relative humidity w.r.t. liquid).  

Additional fields useful when interpolating or extrapolating near the WRF 
model terrain field include:
* surface pressure
* sea level pressure
* land-sea mask
* sea-ice fraction
* 2-m temperature
* 2-m relative humidity
* 10-m horizontal winds
* skin temperature, and 
* terrain height.  

Although many of these fields are available in the raw MERRA files, some must 
be derived from other variables (e.g., geopotential height on model levels) 
or only exist as 1-hour averages rather than instantaneous analysis fields.  
Variables are also distributed among several different file types (called 
"collections" in the MERRA terminology).  Thus, MERRA2WRF is designed to 
process certain variables in specific collection files before writing out the 
data in WPS format.

DATA REQUIREMENTS

When using MERRA2WRF, the following files and variables MUST be available 
in HDF4 or netCDF format:

const_2d_asm_Nx data:
* XDim (longitude)
* YDim (latitude)
* PHIS (surface geopotential)
* FRLAKE (lake fraction)
* FROCEAN (ocean fraction)

inst6_3d_ana_Nv data:
* longitude (longitude)
* latitude (latitude)
* time (synoptic hour)
* levels (nominal pressure for each model level)
* ps (surface pressure)
* delp (layer pressure thicknesses)
* t (layer temperature)
* u (layer eastward wind)
* v (layer northward wind)
* qv (layer specific humidities)

inst6_3d_ana_Np data:
* longitude (longitude)
* latitude (latitude)
* time (synoptic hours)
* slp (sea level pressure)

tavg1_2d_slv_Nx data:
* longitude (longitude)
* latitude (latitude)
* time (synoptic hours)
* u10 (10-meter eastward wind)
* v10 (10-meter northward wind)
* t2m (2-meter temperature)
* qv2m (2-meter specific humidity)
* ts (skin temperature)

tavg1_2d_ocn_Nx data:
* longitude (longitude)
* latitude (latitude)
* time (synoptic hours)
* frseaice (sea ice fraction)

NOTE:  The tavg1_2d_slv_Nx and tavg1_2d_ocn_Nx files contain 1-hourly 
averages that are nominally valid at the bottom of an hour.  For simplicity,
the code is designed to use the 00:30Z averaged data with 00Z instantaneous
fields, 06:30Z hourly data with 06Z instantaneous fields, and so on.

NOTE:  The GES DISC web page allows for subsampling of MERRA data.
The MERRA2WRF code supports this by comparing the number of
grid points, grid resolution, and southwest latitude/longitude between
each file to ensure consistency.  Users are encouraged to only request
the required variables listed above for each data collection--any additional
variables will be ignored by MERRA2WRF, and will simply waste disk space.

NAMELIST FILE

A namelist.merra2wrf file is provided, and contains one namelist block:

&input

  outputDirectory ! String, lists directory for writing WPS output files
  merraDirectory ! String, lists directory containing MERRA input files
  merraFormat_const_2d_asm_Nx ! Integer, specifies format of const_2d_asm_Nx
                              ! file.  1=HDF4, 2=netCDF
  merraFile_const_2d_asm_Nx ! String, name of const_2d_asm_Nx file
  numberOfDays ! Integer, lists number of days to process.  Each MERRA 
               ! collection (excluding const_2d_asm_Nx) will have one file
               ! per day.
  merraDates(:) ! Array of strings, listing each day to be processed 
                ! (format is YYYY-MM-DD).
  merraFormat_inst6_3d_ana_Nv ! Integer, specifies format of inst6_3d_ana_Nv
                              ! files.  1=HDF4, 2=netCDF
  merraFiles_inst6_3d_ana_Nv(:) ! Array of strings, specifying names of
                                ! inst6_3d_ana_Nv files.
  merraFormat_inst6_3d_ana_Np ! Integer, specifies format of inst6_3d_ana_Np
                              ! files.  1=HDF4, 2=netCDF
  merraFiles_inst6_3d_ana_Np(:) ! Array of strings, specifying names of
                                ! inst6_3d_ana_Np files.
  merraFormat_tavg1_2d_slv_Nx ! Integer, specifies format of tavg1_2d_slv_Nx
                              ! files.  1=HDF4, 2=netCDF
  merraFiles_tavg1_2d_slv_Nx(:) ! Array of strings, specifying names of

                                ! tavg1_2d_ocn_Nx files.

COMPILIATION

The user will need to modify the Makefile to list the paths to both HDF4 
and netCDF.  Then, type 'make' to compile the MERRA2WRF executable.  To
remove object files and the executable, type 'make clean'.

FOR NU-WRF USERS:  The NU-WRF build system has been modified to support
the MERRA2WRF 2.0 as a new target.  In the top level directory, type
'./build.sh merra2wrf' to compile.  The discover.cfg and pleiades.cfg
list the paths to the HDF4 and netCDF libraries, and the build scripts pass
this information down to the Makefile.

OTHER COMMENTS

MERRA2WRF does not process any soil data (temperatures, moisture, etc.),
as the land surface model used with MERRA (the GEOS Catchment model) is not
used by WRF.  NU-WRF users should use a LIS restart file and run NU-WRF with 
LIS coupling.  Users of the community WRF are encouraged to use GRIB files 
from LIS; otherwise, soil conditions from another source (e.g., GFS) will have
to be used.

Some care is needed when selecting specific times, as these data are not
conveniently stored within the HDF4 or netCDF files themselves.  In practice,
when ordering data from GES DISC it is recommended to request all available
times for a particular day, and have MERRA2WRF sift through the data and
pick out those values for 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z.

This directory contains source code for the plot_chem program, a very simple
application that uses NCAR Graphics to plot emissions data from 
prep_chem_sources.  

INPUT:

* 'grads.ctl'  A GrADS control file produced by prep_chem_sources.  Users may
               wish to create a symbolic link that points to the actual
               control file, which will have a name like 
	       'india-lc-T-2008-06-11-000000-g1.ctl'

* A GrADS binary file corresponding to the grads.ctl file.  The convention
  followed by prep_chem_sources is to name this file identical to the
  control file *except* that the '.ctl' suffix is replace with '.gra'
  (e.g., 'india-lc-T-2008-06-11-000000-g1.gra')

* An ASCII "map" file containing critical map projection information.  This
  is produced in the NU-WRF modified version of prep_chem_sources.  The naming
  convention is similar to that of the binary file, except the suffix is
  ".map" (e.g., 'india-lc-T-2008-06-11-000000-g1.map')

NOTE:  plot_chem will read in the control file and extract the name of the
binary file from the first line.  It will automatically determine the name
of the "map" file by replacing the suffix.  DO NOT RENAME THE BINARY OR
MAP FILES FROM PREP_CHEM_SOURCES.

OUTPUT:

A NCAR Graphics GKS file called 'gmeta'.  This can be displayed using the
NCAR Graphics idt program ('idt gmeta').

COMMENTS:

This is a simple program intended to quickly generate plots for sanity-checks.
No options are given to change colors, change the contour levels, etc.
Publication-quality plots will require different software.

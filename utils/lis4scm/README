This repository contains a utility for preparing LIS and LDT files for use
by NU-WRF in Single Column Model mode.

The LIS restart and combined LIS/LDT static file normally used by REAL are
modified to make the contents horizontally homogeneous.  The input files must
have 2x2 grids, and the data from the southwest grid box are copied to the 
other points.

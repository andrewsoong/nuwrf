INTRODUCTION

GOCART2WRF 2.0 is a completely rewritten Fortran program used to:  (1) extract
aerosol data from NASA netCDF4 GOCART files; (2) horizontally and vertically
interpolate the fields to the WRF grid; and (3) append them to the initial and
lateral boundary condition files of WRF (wrfinput_d* and wrfbdy_d01).  

A namelist.gocart2wrf file is provided, and contains two namelist blocks:

&wrf
  max_dom ! Integer, number of WRF domains to process
  wrf_dir ! String, lists directory path containing wrfinput and wrfbdy files
/

&gocart_shared
  gocart_format ! Integer, specifies format of GOCART data; currently
                ! must be set to 5 (for netCDF4 files)
  gocart_source ! String, lists source of GOCART data. 4 options are available:
                ! 'GEOS5'    : Output from GEOS-5 (default)
		! 'MERRA2'   : Output from MERRA2 reanalysis
		! 'MERRAERO' : Output from MERRAERO reanalysis
		! 'OFFLINE'  : Output from offline GOCART
  gocart_dir    ! String, lists directory path containing NetCDF4 GOCART
                ! files to process.
		! NOTE: If processing MERRAERO or MERRA2 data, files are
		! assumed to be in subdirectories, e.g.,
		! For MERRAERO:  gocart_dir/Y2005/M05/
		! For MERRA2:    gocart_dir/$STREAM/stage/Y2005/M05/
		!   where $STREAM is MERRA2_100 (for data before 1992), 
		!   MERRA2_200 (for data from 1992 to 2000), 
		!   MERRA3_300 (for data from 2001 to 2010), or
		!   MERRA2_400 (for data from 2011 on)
  gocart_prefix ! String, lists file name prefix for netCDF4 GOCART
                ! files. Ignored if processing MERRA2 or MERRAERO data.

DATA REQUIREMENTS

GOCART2WRF only supports four types of GOCART netCDF4 files:

GEOS5: $PREFIX.$YYYY$MM$DD_$HH$mmz.nc4, where $PREFIX is the string defined 
in the namelist.gocart2wrf "gocart_prefix" variable; $YYYY is the 4-digit year;
$MM is the 2-digit month, $DD is the 2-digit day of the month; $HH is the 
2-digit hour of the day, and $mm is the 2-digit minute of the hour. It is 
assumed each file has a SINGLE time level.

MERRA2: $STREAM.inst3_3d_aer_Nv.$YYYY$MM$DD.nc4, where $STREAM is the 
year-dependent MERRA2 stream (see above), and $YYY, $MM, and $DD have the same
meaning as for GEOS5. It is assumed each file has EIGHT time levels (3-hourly
starting from 00Z).

MERRAERO: dR_MERRA-AA-r2.inst3d_aer_v.$YYYY$MM$DD_$HH$mmz.nc4, where $YYYY, 
$MM, $DD, and $mm have the same meaning as for GEOS5. It is assumed each file
has a SINGLE time level.

OFFLINE: Four different filetypes must be used together:

$PREFIX_cc_tracer_3HINST_$YYYY$MM$DD.nc
$PREFIX_du_tracer_3HINST_$YYYY$MM$DD.nc
$PREFIX_ss_tracer_3HINST_$YYYY$MM$DD.nc
$PREFIX_su_tracer_3HINST_$YYYY$MM$DD.nc

where $PREFIX, $YYYY, $MM, and $DD are specified as for GEOS5. It is assumed
each file has EIGHT time levels (3-hourly starting from 00Z).

When run, GOCART2WRF will first loop through the wrfinput and wrfbdy files to
collect the specific dates and times required for processing, and then open
and read the GOCART files as necessary.  The wrfinput and wrfbdy files *will be
changed* to add the interpolated GOCART variables, so it is recommended that
"backup" copies of these files be kept (e.g., with a _orig suffix).  If an
array to be written already exists, the values will be overwritten unless
the datatype and dimensions differ from what GOCART2WRF wants to write; in
this special case the program will abort.

Other comments:

* Currently the input and output variables names are hardwired in the code.
  If the version of GOCART in WRF changes, or if the GOCART file contents 
  differ from what is expected, then the user will need to edit the source 
  code accordingly.
* The version of GOCART in WRF does not exactly match that used by NASA.
  The major difference is that the first sea salt category (ss001) is 
  excluded in WRF.  Thus, when running, GOCART2WRF will substitute
  ss002 for SEAS_1 (in the wrfinput file), ss003 for SEAS_2, etc.
* GOCART2WRF 2.0 must be linked against a version of netCDF4 that was built
  with HDF5.  This will allow the program to read netCDF4 files that
  were written with compression.

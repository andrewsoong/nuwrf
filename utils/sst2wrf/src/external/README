This directory contains Fortran 90 source code from Remote Sensing Systems 
(RSS).  There are two files, each with one subroutine:

read_rss_mwir_sst.f reads version-1 RSS Microwave Infrared Optimal 
Interpolation daily sea surface temperature analyses.  Thes data are global 
~9km resolution.

read_rss_oisst_v2.f reads version-2 RSS Optimal Interpolation daily sea
surfce temperature analyses generated from TMI and/or AMSR-E data.  The data
are global at ~0.25 deg resolution.

The source code is written in Fortran 90, but is in DOS text file format and
includes tabs rather than spaces.  Also, the .f suffix will cause many 
compilers to assume the files are fixed-format files, resulting in syntax
errors due to long (> 80 column) lines.  To avoid this latter problem, the
Makefile creates symbolic links with the suffix .f90, and compiles the
symbolic links.
======Updated on Oct 28, 2014 Jossy Jacob for V4 OISST data ============
Added read_rss_mw_sst.f renamed as read_rss_oisst_v4.f  
!       This routine reads version-4 RSS MW-only, daily SST files made from any of the available 
!     microwave radiometers capable of measuring SST: TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR2, WindSat, GMI
!       You must UNZIP FILES before reading them
!       sst_data  0.25x0.25 deg resolution (a 1440 x 720 real*4 array of Sea Surface Temperature)
read_rss_mwir_sst.f
!       This routine reads version-4 RSS MW IR OI SST daily files
!       You must UNZIP FILES before reading them
!       sst_data ~9km resolution  (a 4096 x 2048 real*4 array of SST data)

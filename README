The NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model is an 
observation-driven regional earth system modeling and assimilation system 
at satellite-resolvable scale. NU-WRF is one of three major earth system 
modeling systems funded by NASAâ€™s Modeling Analysis and Prediction (MAP) 
program.

WRF-Chem Testcase

This is a test case that uses:
  (a) CONUS SE quadrant domain (98W-75W, 25N-42N) with 2 nests (12-4 km)
      Lambert projection
  (b) Simulation time period from 12Z 10 Apr 2009 to 12Z 11 Apr 2009
  (c) MODIS geographical data, NCEP NAM data
  (d) GOCART aerosol data from GEOS5 
      GOCART2WRF executable used to process GOCART data and insert into
      REAL output files
  (e) PREP_CHEM_SOURCES processes emissions data into intermediate files
      GFEDv4 emissions
  (f) CONVERT_EMISS processes files generated in (f) into WRF-Chem input
  (g) Goddard MP (3ice) and Goddard 2014 radiation (option 56) with 
      aerosol coupling.

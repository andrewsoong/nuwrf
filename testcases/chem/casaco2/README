Use of CASA CO2 data

This is a test case that uses:
  (a) Entire CONUS (120W-75W, 20N-55N) with 2 nests (27-9 km)
      Lambert projection
  (b) Simulation time period from 00Z 20 Mar 2010 to 00Z 01 Apr 2010
  (c) USGS geographical data, NCEP FNL data
  (d) Run REAL 
  (e) Use casa2wrf to combine CO2 fluxes from various sources and modify
      REAL output to generate WRF-Chem input
  (f) Note WRF-Chem is NOT executed.

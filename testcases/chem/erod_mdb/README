MODIS-Deep-Blue-derived erodible soil for dust emissions testcase

This is a test case that uses:
  (a) Middle East / Mediterranean domain (0E-60W, 10N-40N) with 1 nests (20 km)
      Lambert projection
  (b) Simulation time period from 00Z 28 Feb 2012 to 00Z 02 Mar 2012
  (c) MODIS geographical data, NCEP FNL data
      Uses a monthly surface bareness field derived at 30 arc second
      resolution from MODIS vegetation (greenness_fpar_modis)
  (g) Goddard MP (4ice) and Goddard 2014 radiation (option 56)
      WRF-Chem erod_option = 'mdb'

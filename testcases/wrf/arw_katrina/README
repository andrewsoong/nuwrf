By default, this test uses SST data which is not required by WRF model. 

SST data: 0.5 deg GRIB1 data, available for 2005-08-27_00 to 2005-09-01_00. 
Vtable.SST specifies which fields are used.

namelist_sst.wps used by ungrib_sst (default)
namelist_reg.wps used by geogrid and metgrid

When running metgrid, we can choose to: 
(1) add SST for the initial time only (default):
  fg_name = 'FILE'
  constants_name = './SST:2005-08-28_00' 
(2) add SST fields at each time (change namelist_reg.wps):
  fg_name = 'FILE', 'SST' 

Case (2) is better for "long" runs.

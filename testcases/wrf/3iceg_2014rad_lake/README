WRF-ARW Testcase (Shi et al test case with WRF-lake physics)

This is a test case that uses:
  (a) CONUS NE quadrant domain (98W-68W, 34N-53N) with 3 nests (9-3-3 km)
      Lambert projection
  (b) Simulation time period from 12Z 19 Jan 2007 to 12Z 23 Jan 2007
      WRF test run is only 3 hrs
  (c) USGS geographical data, NCEP FNL (Final) Operational Global Analysis data
  (d) intermediate file containing a daily-average surface air temperature field
      substituted for the SST field over lakes (TAVGSFC)
  (e) Goddard MP (3ice) and Goddard 2014 radiation (option 56)
  (f) WRF-Lake physics (sf_lake_physics)

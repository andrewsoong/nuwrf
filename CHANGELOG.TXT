Release Tag: v10-wrf391-lisf (23 May 2019) -- "Dalton"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First official NU-WRF release on the NASA GitHub repository. This release
is based on the v9p3-wrf391-lis72 software stack with additional modifications:

  - LIS, LDT and LVT code versions are those from the LISF repository.
  - The WRFV3 directory has been renamed to WRF.
  - LISF, WPS and WRF are maintained as subtrees. This allows these components
    to be maintained as NU-WRF dependencies.
  - External libraries have also been re-built consistent with LISF builds.
  - ARWpost, UPP, MET and RIP4 applications are no longer part of the software
    stack and are not under version control. On Discover the application tarballs
    are stored in the NU-WRF file system and retrieved, uncompressed and
    installed at build time - if so requested. On non-DISCOVER systems users
    will be prompted to provide a tarball and the build system will install it.
  - Updated build system.
  - Updated NU-WRF user guide.
  - Updated tutorial documentation and testcases.
